# Debian Mosquitto MQTT Broker

MQTT message broker service based on the [Debian docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian), see https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto for details. This is provided here as an alternative to the official [Mosquitte image](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto) as the latter does not provide a ARMv7 build.
