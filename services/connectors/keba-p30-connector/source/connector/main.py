    Bundles all functionality to handle sensor messages.

    This is a template for a SensorFlow class, i.e. one that holds all
    functions that are necessary to handle messages from the device(s)
    towards the message broker. The methods could also be implemented
    into the Connector class, but are seperated to support clarity.

    Overload these functions
    ------------------------
    In order to transform this class into operational code you need
    to inherit from it and overload the following methods:
     - receive_raw_msg
     - parse_raw_msg

    Connector Methods
    -----------------
    The connector must provide the following methods to allow correct
    operation of the methods in this class:
     - _update_available_datapoints

    Connector Attributes
    --------------------
    The following attributes must be set up by the connector to
    allow these methods to run correctly:

    mqtt_client : class instance.
        Initialized Mqtt client library with signature of paho mqtt.
    SEND_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB : string
        if SEND_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB == "TRUE" will send raw message
        to designated DB via MQTT.
    MQTT_TOPIC_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB : string
        The topic which on which the raw messages will be published.
    datapoint_map : dict of dict.
        Mapping from datapoint key to topic. Is generated by the AdminUI.
        Looks e.e. like this:
            datapoint_map = {
                "sensor": {
                    "Channel__P__value__0": "example-connector/msgs/0001",

        # In theory, data could be sent and received using a single datagram
        # socket. However, since KEBA always sends replies to the fixed port
        # 7090, we would have to bind our socket to that port. This would
        # result in data also being sent from port 7090. Although this seems

        # (NAT), especially docker.
        # When the controller sends data from port 7090, the conntrack
        # mechanism of the NAT will insert a (firewall) rule attempting to
        # deliver replies to port 7090 back to the expected endpoint behind the
        # NAT. Since UDP is stateless, this conntrack rule only expires after
        # a certain timeout. When a docker container is restarted, stale rules
        # may prevent the new container from using port 7090 to send and
        # receive data.
        # As a workaround to this problem, we use two datagram sockets. We send
        # from a socket with a random port, for which the conntrack rules will
