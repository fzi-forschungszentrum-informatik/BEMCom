class SensorFlow(SFTemplate):
    """
    Bundles all functionality to handle sensor messages.

    This is a template for a SensorFlow class, i.e. one that holds all
    functions that are necessary to handle messages from the device(s)
    towards the message broker. The methods could also be implemented
    into the Connector class, but are separated to support clarity.

    Overload these functions
    ------------------------
    In order to transform this class into operational code you need
    to inherit from it and overload the following methods:
     - receive_raw_msg
     - parse_raw_msg

    Connector Methods
    -----------------
    The connector must provide the following methods to allow correct
    operation of the methods in this class:
     - _update_available_datapoints

    Connector Attributes
    --------------------
    The following attributes must be set up by the connector to
    allow these methods to run correctly:

    mqtt_client : class instance.
        Initialized Mqtt client library with signature of paho MQTT.
    SEND_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB : string
        if SEND_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB == "TRUE" will send raw message
        to designated DB via MQTT.
    MQTT_TOPIC_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB : string
        The topic which on which the raw messages will be published.
    datapoint_map : dict of dict.
        Mapping from datapoint key to topic. Is generated by the AdminUI.
        Looks e.e. like this:
            datapoint_map = {
                "sensor": {
                    "Channel__P__value__0": "example-connector/msgs/0001",
                    "Channel__P__unit__0": "example-connector/msgs/0002",
                },
                "actuator": {
                    "example-connector/msgs/0003": "Channel__P__setpoint__0",
                }
            }
        Note thereby that the keys "sensor" and "actuator"" must alaways be
        present, even if the child dicts are empty.
    """

    def receive_raw_msg(self, raw_data=None):
        """
        Functionality to receive a raw message from device.

        Poll the device/gateway for data and transforms this raw data
        into the format expected by run_sensor_flow. If the device/gateway
        uses some protocol that pushes data, the raw data should be passed
        as the raw_data argument to the function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        raw_data : TYPE, optional
            Raw data of device/gateway if the device pushes and is not
            pulled for data. The default is None.

        Returns
        -------
        msg : dict
            The message object containing the raw data. It must be
            JSON serializable (to allow sending the raw_message object as JSON
            object to the raw message DB). If the data received from the device
            or gateway cannot be packed to JSON directly (like e.g. for bytes)
            it must modified accordingly. Avoid manipulation of the data as much
            as possible, to prevent data losses when these operations fail.
            A simple solution may often be to cast the raw data to strings.
            Dict structures are fine, especially if created in this function,
            e.g. by iterating over many endpoints of one device.
            Should be formatted like this:
                msg = {
                    "payload": {

                    }
                }
            E.g.
                msg = {
                    "payload": {
                        "raw_message": "device_1:{sensor_1:2.12,sensor_2:3.12}"

    The generic logic of the connector.

    It should not be necessary to overload any of these methods nor
    to call any of those apart from __init__() and run().

    Configuration Attributes
    ------------------------
    Confiugration will be populated from environment variables on init.
    CONNECTOR_NAME : string
        The name of the connector instance as seen by the AdminUI.
    MQTT_TOPIC_LOGS : string
        The topics used by the log handler to publish log messages on.
    MQTT_TOPIC_HEARTBEAT : string
        The topics used by the connector to publish heartbeats on.
    MQTT_TOPIC_AVAILABLE_DATAPOINTS : string
        The topic on which the available datapoints will be published.
    MQTT_TOPIC_DATAPOINT_MAP : string
        The topic the connector will listen on for datapoint maps
    SEND_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB : string
        if SEND_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB == "TRUE" will send raw message
        to designated DB via MQTT. This is a string and not a bool as
        environment variables are always strings.
    MQTT_TOPIC_RAW_MESSAGE_TO_DB : string
        The topic which on which the raw messages will be published.
    DEBUG : string
        if DEBUG == "TRUE" will log debug message to, elso loglevel is info.
    MODBUS_MASTER_IP : string
        The ip adress or DNS name of the Modbus master device which we want
        to connect to.
    MODBUS_MASTER_PORT : string (as env variables are always strings)
        The port on which  the master device awaits Modbus communication.

    Computed Attributes
    -------------------
    These attributes are created by init and are then dynamically used
    by the Connector.
    mqtt_client : class instance.
        Initialized MQTT client library with signature of paho mqtt.
    available_datapoints : dict of dict.
        Lists all datapoints known to the connector and is sent to the
        AdminUI. Actuator datapoints must be specified manually. Sensor
        datapoints are additionally automatically added once a value for
        a new datapoint is received. The object contains the connector
        internal key and a sample and value looks e.g. like this:
            available_datapoints = {
                "sensor": {
                    "Channel__P__value__0": 0.122,
                    "Channel__P__unit__0": "kW",

                }
            }
    datapoint_map : dict of dict.
        Mapping from datapoint key to topic. Is generated by the AdminUI.
        Looks e.e. like this:
            datapoint_map = {
                "sensor": {
                    "Channel__P__value__0": "example-connector/msgs/0001",
